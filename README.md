Introduction
This is the first experiment in the Digital Communications Lab. In this experiment, we study the most basic 
method for assessing the performance of digital communication systems, the Bit Error Rate. We also study 
simple models for communication channels and their effect on the communication system from the 
perspective of bit error rate.
Background
The most basic target of the study of digital communications is to understand digital communication systems 
and how digital information can be conveyed from a source or transmitter to a destination or receiver over a 
channel. Depending on the communication systems, channels can be wired circuits, wireless channels, 
satellite channels and so on. The study of digital communications begins by transforming the digital
communication system into an equivalent mathematical model, and then attempts to design transmitters 
and receivers which achieves the target of information transmission over the channel in an efficient manner.
Figure 1 shows an example of a digital communication system. The goal of the transmitter and receiver is to 
deliver the digital data from the source to the sink in the best way possible. There are several ways to define 
what best mean: one of the most common and most important methods to assess the performance of a 
communication system is the Bit Error Rate (BER).
